# srt-slurm patches

The srt driver ([`infx/launch/drivers/srt/checkout.py`](../../../infx/launch/drivers/srt/checkout.py)) applies every `*.patch` here to the job's srt-slurm clone after checking out the pinned submodule. TileRT jobs use the fork checkout and skip these patches.

Each patch is a temporary fix for an open upstream PR. When the PR merges and the submodule pin includes it, delete the patch and its row.

| Patch | Upstream PR | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| _(none)_ | | No patches are currently carried; the pinned submodule (v2.30.0) includes everything the runners need. |
