# In-tree patches for the MoRI / MoRIIO PD-disagg path

This directory carries small overlays that fix up the engine source inside
the docker container at runtime. They are needed because some published
images ship known bugs in the (MoRI / MoRIIO) disaggregation backend that
block our benchmark + accuracy configs — so we can keep reusing the
**stock image** instead of rebuilding a patched one.

- `mori_conn.py` — single-file overlay (bind-mounted) for the **sglang**
  MoRI backend.

> Note: the vLLM MoRIIO `minimax-m3` overlay (`moriio/`) was retired once the
> upstream fixes (vLLM #46039 / #46290 / #46332) shipped in the ROCm nightly
> image; `minimaxm3-fp8-mi355x-vllm-disagg` now runs the stock nightly directly.

The `mori_conn.py` overlay is wired through the `EXTRA_DOCKER_MOUNTS` env
var that `job.slurm` consumes (an opt-in `${EXTRA_DOCKER_MOUNTS:-}` after
the existing `-v` block). The local-test driver scripts under
`scripts/sglang_disagg/` pre-set this env var to the path of the relevant
overlay; CI runners that need the patch can do the same.

Source: forked from the file shipped in
`lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.12.post1-rocm720-mi35x-20260523`
(sglang [v0.5.12.post1](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/v0.5.12.post1)).
Four logical edits, all confined to `MoriKVReceiver.send_state`,
`MoriKVReceiver._register_kv_args`, and
`MoriKVReceiver._send_swa_dsa_state`:

1. **Sender flatten** — handle the framework's nested
   `state_item_lens: List[List[int]]` instead of crashing in the
   naked `struct.pack("I", item_len)` (the legacy `List[int]`
   assumption). Idempotent for legacy flat callers.
2. **`state_type` legacy fallback** — when the legacy singular
   `kv_args.state_type` is `'none'` but `state_mem_descs` is non-empty,
   read `kv_args.state_types[0]` (the modern plural API that Mooncake
   and NIXL already use). Routes `MAMBA → _send_mamba_state` and
   `DSA/SWA → _send_swa_dsa_state` correctly.
3. **Consumer normalization** — flatten `state_item_lens` and
   `state_dim_per_tensor` to flat `List[int]` once at the entry of
   `send_state`, so the existing per-tensor index arithmetic
   (`state_item_lens[i]`) and length checks
   (`len(state_item_lens) == len(state_mem_descs)`) keep working.
4. **DSA index rank+length normalization** — inside
   `_send_swa_dsa_state`, before the `group_concurrent_contiguous`
   call, ravel both `src_state_indices` and `dst_state_indices` to 1-D
   and re-truncate to common length. Upstream's existing truncation
   only slices the outer axis, leaving 2-D `(1, N)` arrays unchanged
   and triggering an `np.diff` broadcasting error
   (`shapes (1,12) (0,)`) for GLM-5 (single-DSA-component) prefill
   traffic. See
   `scripts/sglang_disagg/docs_glm5/01-bug-analysis.md` for the full
   write-up.

Verified passing GSM8K = 0.978 ± 0.004 on Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-FP8 1P+1D
TP=8 dp-attn=false (matches and slightly exceeds upstream
[PR #22665](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22665)'s
reported 0.970 GSM8K on the bf16 baseline). GLM-5 (DSA) verification
in progress under
`scripts/sglang_disagg/docs_glm5/02-fix-and-verification.md`.

This is a stop-gap. The proper upstream fix is to migrate MoRI to the
plural `state_types: List[StateType]` API (full design + diff in
`scripts/sglang_disagg/docs/03-upstream-pr-proposal.md`).

## How to enable

```bash
export EXTRA_DOCKER_MOUNTS="-v $DI_REPO_DIR/benchmarks/multi_node/amd_utils/patches/mori_conn.py:/sgl-workspace/sglang/python/sglang/srt/disaggregation/mori/conn.py:ro"
```

`$DI_REPO_DIR` is the InferenceX checkout root that `job.slurm`
already mounts into the container at `/workspace`.

When this env var is unset (CI default for runs that don't need the
patch), `${EXTRA_DOCKER_MOUNTS:-}` expands to the empty string and
container behavior is byte-identical to the unpatched path.

## When to use which patch

| Image / version | Need `mori_conn.py` overlay? |
|---|---|
| `lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.12.post1-rocm720-mi35x-20260523` | yes (Qwen3.5-MoE-FP8, GLM-5, any hybrid model on this image) |
| `lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.10.post1-rocm720-mi35x-*` (used by `dsr1-fp4-*-disagg`) | not validated; same code path likely affected — try with the overlay if you hit the same `struct.error` |
| `rocm/sgl-dev:sglang-0.5.9-rocm720-mi35x-mori-*` (used by `dsr1-fp8-*-disagg`, `glm5-*-disagg`) | predates [PR #22665](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22665); different code paths; **do not** apply this overlay |

When upstream merges the proper fix (see
`scripts/sglang_disagg/docs/03-upstream-pr-proposal.md`) and that
fix lands in a published image, retire this overlay and the
`EXTRA_DOCKER_MOUNTS` knob can stay (still useful for future patches).
